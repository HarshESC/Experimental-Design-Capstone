The dataset is quite interesting in how it describes employees job satisfaction in level with various factors, including promotion, salaries, and other similar factors.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Today, I would focus on how an employee's daily rate can impact job satisfaction at IBM.  The job satisfaction ranges from 1 to 4, with 1 being low jobsatisfaction while 4 is high job satisfaction.  I would like analyze how employees having higher daily rates can lead to a greater frequency of job satisfaction at IBM.\n",

At around 800 Daily Rate, is where more people seem to have a higher satisfaction rating.  "

        "As a next step in the process, let's examine whether certain job roles can influence the amount of satisfaction.  We can allocate those to the amount of pay they receive, and once again analyze how the job role has an influence on the satisfaction levels.  We can analyze possibly through pie charts and histograms.\n",

        "While the current data definetely indicates how much pay affects attrition, I think the followup of Job roles can help us clearly distinguish what areas need improvement.  This makes for a non-risky, clear, inexpensive way to follow up the finding of the research.  \n"
