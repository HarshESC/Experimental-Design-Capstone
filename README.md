I would focus on how an employee's daily rate can impact job satisfaction at IBM. The job satisfaction ranges from 1 to 4, with 1 being low jobsatisfaction while 4 is high job satisfaction. I would like analyze how employees having higher daily rates can lead to a greater frequency of job satisfaction at IBM.
